# Attendance-by-face-recognition
"Attendance by Face Recognition" is a Python project that uses OpenCV, Flask, datetime, numpy, scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier, pandas, and joblib. It implements face recognition for attendance tracking and provides a user-friendly interface with HTML integration.

"Attendance by Face Recognition" is a Python project that leverages various technologies and libraries to implement a face recognition-based attendance system. The project utilizes the following components:

# 1.OpenCV (cv2):
Used for capturing video frames, detecting faces, and performing facial recognition tasks.

# 2.Flask:
A web framework used to develop the user interface and handle HTTP requests and responses.

# 3.datetime:
Enables the retrieval of the current date and time for attendance tracking.

# 4.numpy:
A library used for numerical operations, particularly for handling arrays and matrices.

# 5.scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier:
Employed for building and training a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier model for face recognition.

# 6.pandas:
Used for data manipulation and processing, such as reading and analyzing attendance data.

# 7.joblib:
Enables the saving and loading of trained machine learning models for efficient deployment.

These libraries and technologies are integrated into the Python files to implement the face recognition functionality, capture attendance data, and provide a user-friendly interface. The HTML code is embedded within the Flask framework to render the web pages, display attendance information, and enable user interaction.

Overall, the "Attendance by Face Recognition" project combines computer vision, machine learning, and web development to create an automated attendance system based on face recognition technology.
